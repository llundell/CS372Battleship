8 Feb 19
Drafted user stories--
We started getting into the details before realizing we should write down the
basics of the game requirements. [20 minutes]

Initialized Github repository

11 Feb 19
Ranked difficulty of user stories--
Decided on the 1-5 ranking system (1 being easiest) but may consider changing
this system based on how it works with tracking and measuring progress.
[20 minutes]

12 Feb 19
Listened to project presentations from other groups and jotted down some ideas
we may implement--
Questions going forward:
Graphics interface?
Testing framework?
Play against an AI agent?
Leader boards?
Sound effects?
Web based?
Rotate a board?

Other thoughts:
Implement by test driven development -- why do you need a board? Makes you question

17 Feb 19
Discussing how best to prioritize the User Stories
Reviewing Agile Principles
Decided to use Trello board to organize our work, as a Kanban board and using Agile Power-up option.
We added "This Sprint" to our work categories to implement a feature of development in Scrum.  (3  (3))

19 Feb 19
Started first sprint today and decided to keep it to 3 days long, with the first 2 user stories we prioritized.
Started Pair Programming: Loviisa was the observer and I was the driver for this round.
Loviisa mastered the whiteboard sketches (we both decided we need to own one personally) while I plunked away at the code.

We wrote the test first, but once we got the code to compile to simply create a board, it wouldn't compile with the test.
It's likely a syntax issue that we'll have to iron out.

21 Feb 19
Tried dozens of configurations for the test case for vector--

22 Feb 19
Created outline for our presentation

23 Feb 19
Finally got the first test to compile! It fails but at least it compiles.
Figured out I had to create a vector in the test case, set the size to 25 then check if it equaled the vector size created in the function.
